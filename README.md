# C++ Caesar Cypher
#### By KimJammer

This program helps encode and decode caesar ciphers using a key.
Choose your mode, and enter some plain text. The characters can 
only be normal alphabet characters, from a to z with no numbers 
or symbols. Then enter your key, which is an int from -26 to 26.

I hope to add a mode with a bigger charset, and a mode for break
ing caesar ciphers. We'll see if I get around to it.


The program isn't designed for unicode characters of any kind, s
o if anything weird happens, that's on you.
